<h4>Main Ingredients</h4>
<p>Cashews: The star ingredient, cashews can be used in different forms: whole, chopped, or ground. They can be roasted or raw, depending on the recipe, and contribute to the cake's texture and flavor.
    Flour: Most cashew cakes are made with all-purpose flour or a mix of flours. In some recipes, almond flour or other gluten-free alternatives can be used.
    Sugar: Typically granulated sugar or sometimes powdered sugar is used to sweeten the cake.
    Butter/Oil: A key ingredient for the cake's richness, butter or oil helps to achieve a moist, tender crumb.
    Eggs: Eggs are commonly used to bind the ingredients together and help with the cake's rise.
    Baking Powder/Soda: These are used to make the cake rise and give it a light, airy texture.
    Milk or Cream: Liquid ingredients like milk or cream are added for moisture and to create the right consistency of the batter.
    Flavorings: Vanilla extract, cardamom, cinnamon, or other spices can be added for extra flavor.
