    <h3>Assam tea Growing Region</h3>
    <h5><b>Assam is located along the Brahmaputra River in northeastern India. The region's climate is hot and humid, with heavy rainfall and rich alluvial soil, ideal for cultivating tea.
        The tea gardens are mostly located at altitudes ranging from 300 to 800 meters above sea level, although higher elevations produce a slightly lighter flavor, Assam Orthodox Tea: Traditionally made using the orthodox method, where leaves are hand-rolled, giving a more complex flavor.
        Assam CTC (Crush, Tear, Curl): A more modern method that produces small, hard pellets of tea leaves, often used for mass-market tea bags. It brews quickly and has a stronger flavor, often used in blends or for making chai.</b></h5>
    <h3>Health Benefits</h3>

        Boosts Energy: The tea has a higher caffeine content compared to other teas, making it a great morning pick-me-up.
        Supports Digestion: Assam tea can help with digestion, particularly when consumed after meals, Chai: Assam tea is a key component in traditional Indian chai, often brewed with spices like cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.
        Milk Tea: Its robust flavor makes it ideal for blending with milk, as it doesnâ€™t get overwhelmed by the milk's creaminess.
        Iced Tea: Assam tea can also be enjoyed iced, providing a refreshing option for warm weather.</p>
