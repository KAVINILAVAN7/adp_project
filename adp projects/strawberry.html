    Frozen strawberry yogurt is a creamy and healthier alternative to ice cream, combining the tangy taste of yogurt with the sweetness of strawberries.
    
    Ingredients:
    Fresh or frozen strawberries
    Plain yogurt or Greek yogurt (for extra creaminess)
    Sweetener (such as sugar, honey, or maple syrup)
    Lemon juice (optional, for brightness)
    Preparation:
    Puree the Strawberries: Blend fresh or frozen strawberries until smooth. You can leave it slightly chunky if you prefer some texture in your frozen yogurt.
    Combine with Yogurt: Mix the strawberry puree with yogurt and sweetener. If using Greek yogurt, it will create a richer, creamier texture.
    Freeze: Pour the mixture into a shallow pan and freeze. Every 30-45 minutes, stir with a fork to break up the ice crystals and create a smooth, scoopable texture. Alternatively, you can use an ice cream maker to churn the mixture, which will help achieve a smoother consistency.
    Serve: Once frozen, serve in bowls or cones.
    Variations:
    Berry Mix: You can add other berries like blueberries or raspberries for a mixed berry version.
    Add-ins: Mix in chocolate chips, granola, or nuts for extra texture.
